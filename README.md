### Concepts used.
I have fetched data from the server using AJAX GET REQUEST and then using Javascript to display the fetched data on the html page.For making the page responsive, some concepts of Bootstrap are used. For styling of the page I have used CSS. To focus on particular detail, just user needs to hover on it. I have added header and footer just for styling , they will not take you to any other page.

### Answer to Explain how your code would change if customer ordered more items (say 7 items)
I developed this page using dynamic Javascript concept which means that we don't need to change our code depending on the number of items ordered by the customer. The length is fetched of items array and then equal number of rows in order details table is added. So if there are 7 items , automatically 7 rows with data will be inserted.
