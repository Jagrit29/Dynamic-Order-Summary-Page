This is my assignment for Web Development Internship under Food Bots. To view the order summary page,just click on the link below.
I developed this page using dynamic Javascript concept which means that we don't need to change our code depending on the number of items ordered by the customer. 
The length is fetched of items array and then equal number of rows in order details table is added. If user want to view detail any closely then he can just hover on the item, it will differentiate from others.
